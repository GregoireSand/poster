REACT POSTER

This project is from the Udemy course 'React - The Complete Guide 2024'. It is a summary of the core features of React. Here is what I worked on during this exercise : 

- Initialize a React app with Vite
- Create components
- Use props and children prop
- Manage the state with useState() and lift the state up
- Event listeners
- Handling forms submission and outputting list data
